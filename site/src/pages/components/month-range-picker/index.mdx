# Month Range Picker

The Month Range Picker allows the user to select a period in months using a calendar. By default, the calendar always displays the current year. If you already have a date entered, the calendar displays the year for that date.

## Best practices

- You can set a minimum and maximum value that the user can choose.
- The field must allow the user to also enter the value through keyboard input.
- If the user should select a period with greater granularity, such as weeks or days, use the [Date Picker](/components/date-picker) component.
