# Date picker

Date components allow the user to make a specific selection through a visual calendar. By default, the calendar always displays the current month. If you already have a date entered, the calendar displays the month for that date.

## Best practices

- Use when the date selected is close to the actual date or for a period of less than 1 year.
- The user should be able to enter values also through the keyboard.
- Use placeholders to indicate the format of the data entry, for example: dd/mm/yyyy or mm/dd/yy, etc..
- The field should have only one input type, and should not be divided into fields for each information (day, month, year).
- Use the Week Range Picker if the selected periods must start on a Sunday and end on a Saturday.
- If the Week Range Picker receives a date range in it's value prop, it must be a week, for example: 05/02/2021 (Sunday) to 05/08/2021 (Saturday). Otherwise, it will not be selected. An example of a invalid entry: 05/03/2021 (Monday) to 05/05/2021 (Wednesday).

## Date picker types

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width={160}>Default</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Simple Date Picker</th>
      <td>
        Recommended when the user knows the date and does not need the calendar to anticipate the dates. Usually used on
        credit card expiration dates.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Range Date Picker</th>
      <td>Used to select a date range.</td>
